/**
 * Desktop shell: collect archives the OS hands to the app and surface the
 * import dialog.
 *
 * Two delivery paths, both carrying file *paths* (the webview never sees the
 * bytes — the desktop-only import route reads them from disk server-side):
 *   - `tauri://drag-drop` — files dropped anywhere on the window; and
 *   - `piwi:open-files` — a poke from the shell after "Open with", a dock
 *     drop, or a second launch with file arguments. The shell only queues and
 *     pokes; draining over IPC means a poke fired before this plugin ran is
 *     never lost — the initial drain below picks those up.
 *
 * Gated on the IPC bridge alone (not the desktop flag): the bridge exists
 * exactly where these events can occur.
