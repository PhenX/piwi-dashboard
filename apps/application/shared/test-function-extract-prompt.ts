/** A page-object method/helper is small; reject pasting a whole file — keeps cost/latency bounded and the model focused. */
export const MAX_EXTRACT_CODE_CHARS = 20_000;

export const EXTRACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You analyze a single Playwright page-object method or helper function's TypeScript/JavaScript source code and extract a structured, reusable pattern describing what it does. You never execute the code — this is text analysis only. Reply strictly as JSON matching the given schema, nothing else.

Rules:
- "kind" is "page-object-method" when the code is a class method acting on "this.page" (or a "page" property) — set "receiver" to a sensible instance variable name (camelCase of the class name) and "importName" to the class name. "kind" is "helper" for a standalone exported function taking a Playwright "page" as its first parameter — "receiver" and "importName" must be null in that case. Use "fixture" only if the function is clearly Playwright fixture setup, not a page action.
- "params" lists the function's own parameters, excluding the leading Playwright handle — that first parameter is often named "page", but may be named anything and typed "Page", "Locator", or a union like "Page | Locator"; if the first parameter is a Playwright handle of any kind, skip it. Infer "type" from the TypeScript annotation, or absent one, from how the value is used.
- A parameter whose type is an object/interface (an options bag like "{ label?: string; testId?: string }", very common in helpers) MUST be typed "object", never "string". Set its "fields" to the object's own property names — from the interface declaration if you can see it, otherwise from the properties the function body actually reads off it. If the parameter is declared as an object OR an array of that object, still type it "object" and list the single object's fields. Never flatten an object parameter into a scalar.
- "steps" is the ordered sequence of page interactions the function performs, one entry per Playwright locator-then-action call (".click()", ".fill(value)", ".check()", ".uncheck()", ".selectOption(value)", ".press(key)"; a "page.goto(...)" call becomes a "goto" step). For each step's "target": "getByTestId('x')" sets "testId" only; "getByRole('role', { name: 'X' })" sets both "role" and "name"; a bare "getByRole('role')" sets only "role"; "getByText"/"getByLabel"/"getByPlaceholder" set "name" to that text and leave "role" null. Skip a step whose locator can't be classified this way rather than guessing.
- "paramSources" maps a step's argument back to a function parameter when that argument IS the parameter (e.g. ".fill(username)" where "username" is a parameter) — "from" is "value" for fill/selectOption/press arguments, "testId" when the parameter is interpolated into a getByTestId call, "text" when interpolated into a name/text match. Omit an entry when a step's value is a literal, not a parameter. When the value comes from a *field* of an object parameter (e.g. ".getByRole('option', { name: opt.value })"), set "param" to the parameter and "path" to that field name ("value") — one entry per field, and each field you reference this way must also appear in that parameter's "fields".
- "steps" must see through wrappers that aren't themselves page interactions: "test.step(...)" / "await test.step(...)" callbacks are transparent — extract the Playwright calls inside them as if the wrapper weren't there. The same goes for try/finally and "await Promise.all([...])".
- Branching and loops: when the body picks between alternative locators for the *same* logical interaction (an if/else chain over which option field was passed, a ".or(...)" locator), emit ONE step for that interaction using the most representative branch, and lower "confidence". Do not emit one step per branch — the pattern is matched against a real recording, which only ever took one path. For a loop that repeats an interaction an unknown number of times, emit the body once.
- A call to another helper in the same project that you cannot see the source of (e.g. "focusVSelect(...)", "getVSelectLocator(...)") is a real interaction you cannot classify. Do not silently drop it and do not guess its target: leave it out of "steps", lower "confidence", and name it in "notes".
- "confidence": your own 0-1 confidence that "steps" faithfully represents what the code does — lower it for loops, conditionals, or calls to other helper functions you can't see the inside of.
- "notes": one short sentence, only when something material could not be represented — unseen helper calls, branches you collapsed, or locators you had to skip. Null when the extraction is clean. This is shown to the user next to the confidence, so be specific about what is missing rather than generic.
- Never invent a step that isn't evidenced by an actual Playwright call in the code. A pattern of one or two well-grounded steps plus an honest "notes" is far more useful than a longer guessed one.`;
